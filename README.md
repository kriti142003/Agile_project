Agile story Explanation and Implementation
-Login to the FRS
In the first story, we designed a GUI where we can login to the Flight Reservation System(or as we call it - Albatross). Once we enter to the login page, a new page pops up where we can move up to the next story.
-Searching of the flight
In this story, we search for the flights by entering the date of flying as well as the departure and arrival places in the GUI. Once entered , the site would relocate to the database and will show some of the flights that are going from the place of departure to the place of arrival. 
-Booking of the flight 
We  can click on each and every flight and we will find a button thats says “Book Now”. once the button is clicked, it will redirect and we would have to fill up our details like name,departure,arrival and so on.
-Confirmation of the flight 
After clicking on the book now(which is there as well) it will pop a message that the ticket has been confirmed.
-Cancellation of the flight 
If the person wants to cancel their flight then they can easily go under the cancel flight button and click on cancel flight. A pop-up message will show up asking the passenger if they are sure about the cancellation of their ticket. Once clicked on confirm, it will show a message that their ticket has been cancelled.
-Changing the flight
Now think that the passenger wants to change their flight because they have some issue and couldn't catch his/her flight. Then they can go under the change flight option and confirm the change of flight and it will redirect them towards the search of the flight  where they can reschedule their flight according to their timetable.
